The GummiFactory is located in Plymouth, Devon, on the south-west coast of the UK. All printing, assembly and calibration is done in-house by specially trained staff, providing top quality at a reasonable price point. We use only engineering grade materials, such as high-end Taulman plastics (US), stainless steel nuts, bolts and washers, and Dynamixel servos (Robotis, Korea).

We are part of Fieldwork Robotics Ltd, a 2016 spin-out company from Plymouth University that focuses on soft and robust robotic technology, aimed at research, teaching and agriculture. As the name of this website indicates, the GummiArm is our bread-and-butter. In fact, the original open-source project was initiated by Dr. Martin F. Stoelen, the founding Director of Fieldwork Robotics Ltd.

We respect and promote open-source culture, and we actively contribute to the GummiArm community. Plans and drawings of our modifications and additions are freely available from our repository, giving you the piece of mind that any purchase from us will give you a future-proof platform that is easy to modify and improve upon. By experienced researchers and students alike.
